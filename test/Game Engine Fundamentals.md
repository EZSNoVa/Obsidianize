Game Engine Fundamentals
This chapter covers the fundamentals of using Bevy as a game engine.
You are expected to be familiar with Bevy programming in general. For that,
see the Bevy Programming Framework chapter.
The topics covered in this chapter are applicable to all projects that want
to use Bevy as more than just an ECS library. If you are making a game or
other app using Bevy, this is for you.
This chapter only covers the general fundamentals. Complex topics that
deserve more extensive coverage have their own chapters in the book:

Input Handling
Window Management
Asset Management
General Graphics Features
2D Graphics
3D Graphics
Audio
Bevy UI Framework
