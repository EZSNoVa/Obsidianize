Access the Asset Data
To access the actual asset data from systems, use the
Assets<T> resource.
You can identify your desired asset using the handle.
untyped handles need to be "upgraded" into typed handles.
#[derive(Resource)]
struct SpriteSheets {
    map_tiles: Handle<TextureAtlas>,
}

fn use_sprites(
    handles: Res<SpriteSheets>,
    atlases: Res<Assets<TextureAtlas>>,
    images: Res<Assets<Image>>,
) {
    // Could be `None` if the asset isn't loaded yet
    if let Some(atlas) = atlases.get(&handles.map_tiles) {
        // do something with the texture atlas
    }
}
Creating Assets from Code
You can also add assets to Assets<T> manually.
Sometimes you need to create assets from code, rather than loading them
from files. Some common examples of such use-cases are:

creating texture atlases
creating 3D or 2D materials
procedurally-generating assets like images or 3D meshes

To do this, first create the data for the asset (an instance of the
asset type), and then add it .add(â€¦) it to the
Assets<T> resource, for it to be stored and tracked by
Bevy. You will get a handle to use to refer to it, just like
any other asset.
fn add_material(
    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<StandardMaterial>>,
) {
    let new_mat = StandardMaterial {
        base_color: Color::rgba(0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0),
        unlit: true,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let handle = materials.add(new_mat);

    // do something with the handle
}
