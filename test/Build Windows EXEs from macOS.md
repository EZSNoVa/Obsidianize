Bevy Version:(any)


Build Windows EXEs from macOS
(also check out the Windows Platform page for info
about developing for Windows generally)
Note: As of Bevy 0.12, the instructions on this page no longer work!
There are some dependencies that assume you are running Windows and they
can run Windows EXEs from their build scripts, which is not the case when
cross-compiling.
However, I decided to leave this page in the book, because it could be useful
for other Rust projects (that do not use Bevy or something else that pulls
in broken dependencies).

Rust offers two different toolchains for building for Windows:

MSVC
GNU

On macOS, the GNU software is not readily-available. I don't know how it could
be installed. Even if possible, it might be difficult to set up.
This page will teach you how to setup a MSVC-based toolchain, which works on
macOS and can be set up similarly to how it can be done on
Linux.. You will need to accept Microsoft licenses.
The instructions on this page use the x86_64 architecture, but you could also
set up a toolchain to target i686 (32-bit) or aarch64 (Windows-on-Arm) the
same way.
First-Time Setup
Rust Toolchain
Add the target to your Rust installation (assuming you use rustup):
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

This installs the files Rust needs to compile for Windows, including the
Rust standard library.
Microsoft Windows SDKs
You need to install the Microsoft Windows SDKs, just like when working on
Windows. This can be done with an easy script called xwin. You need to accept
Microsoft's proprietary license.
Install xwin:
cargo install xwin

Now, use xwin to accept the Microsoft license, download all the files
from Microsoft servers, and install them to a directory of your choosing.
(The --accept-license option is to not prompt you, assuming you have already
seen the license. To read the license and be prompted to accept it, omit that
option.)
To install to .xwin/ in your home folder:
xwin --accept-license splat --disable-symlinks --output /Users/me/.xwin

On Windows and macOS, the filesystem is case-insensitive. On Linux and BSD, the
filesystem is case-sensitive. xwin was made for Linux, so it tries to work
around this by default, by creating symlinks. On macOS, we need to tell xwin
not to do this, using the --disable-symlinks option.
Linking
Rust needs to know how to link the final EXE file.
The default Microsoft linker (link.exe) is only available on Windows. Instead,
we need to use the LLD linker (this is also recommended when working on Windows
anyway).
Installing LLD
Unfortunately, last I checked, neither brew nor macports offer packages (LLD
is not commonly used when developing for macOS).
We can, however, build it ourselves from source. You need a C++ compiler and
CMake. You probably already have the C++ toolchain installed, if you have
installed Apple XCode development tools.
CMake can be installed from brew (Homebrew):
brew install cmake

Now, we are ready to compile LLD from the LLVM project:
Note: the --depth=1 option to git clone allows us to save a lot of disk
space and download bandwidth, because the LLVM respository is huge.
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
cd llvm-project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=lld -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ../llvm
sudo make -j10 install # adjust `-j10` based on your number of CPU cores
cd ../../; rm -rf llvm-project # delete the git repo and build files to free disk space

This will install it to /usr/local. Change the path above if you would rather
have it somewhere else, to not pollute your macOS or need sudo / root privileges.
Using LLD
We also need to tell Rust to use our linker, and the location of the Microsoft
Windows SDK libraries (that were installed with xwin in the previous
step).
Add this to .cargo/config.toml (in your home folder or in your bevy project):
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
linker = "/usr/local/bin/lld"
rustflags = [
  "-Lnative=/Users/me/.xwin/crt/lib/x86_64",
  "-Lnative=/Users/me/.xwin/sdk/lib/um/x86_64",
  "-Lnative=/Users/me/.xwin/sdk/lib/ucrt/x86_64"
]

Note: you need to specify the correct full absolute paths to the SDK files,
wherever you installed them.
Building Your Project
Finally, with all the setup done, you can just build your Rust/Bevy projects
for Windows:
cargo build --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --release
