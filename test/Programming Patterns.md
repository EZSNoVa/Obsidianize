Programming Patterns
This chapter is about any non-obvious tricks, programming techniques,
patterns and idioms, that may be useful when programming with Bevy.
These topics are an extension of the topics covered in the Bevy Programming
Framework chapter. See that chapter to learn the
foundational concepts.
Some of the things covered in this chapter might be controversial or only useful
to specific use cases. Don't take this chapter as teaching "general best
practice".
