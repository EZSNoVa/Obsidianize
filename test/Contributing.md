Bevy Version:(any)


Contributing
Be civil. If you need a code of conduct, have a look at Bevy's.
If you have any suggestions for the book, such as ideas for new content, or
if you notice anything that is incorrect or misleading, please file issues in
the GitHub repository!
GitHub Issues
If you want something to be added or changed in the book, file an issue! Tell
me what you want, and I will figure out how to present it in the book. If you
have some code snippet or other thing you want to include, you can
put it in the issue.
That sort of workflow works much better for me, compared to Pull Requests. I am
quite opinionated and meticulous about how everything is presented in the book,
so I often can't just merge/accept things as written by someone else.
GitHub Pull Requests
PLEASE DO NOT CREATE PULL REQUESTS FOR BOOK CONTENT.
The only exception to this might be trivial fixes. If you are just fixing
a typo or small mistake, or a bug in some code example, that's fine.
If you are adding or changing any of the book content, your PR will probably be
ignored or closed. I will probably treat it like I do issues: go do the thing
myself eventually, and then close your PR.
PRs create more work for me. They make life harder, not easier. Every time
someone has made a PR before, I've had to basically rewrite it / redo
the work myself. And also figure out how to respond to the author. And
also wrangle merge conflicts and git branches. Please don't. I'm tired.
Licensing
To avoid complications with copyright and licensing, you agree to provide
any contributions you make to the project under the MIT-0 No Attribution

Note that this allows your work to be relicensed without preserving your
copyright.
As described previously, the actual published content in the book will be my
own derivative work based on your contributions. I will license it consistently
with the rest of the book; see: License.
